Bug tracker
-----------

The bug tracker is [here on github](http://github.com/jjlee/mechanize/issues).
It's equally acceptable to file bugs on the tracker or post about them to the
mailing list.


Contact
-------

There is a [mailing
list](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/wwwsearch-general).  I prefer
questions and comments to be sent there rather than direct to me.
