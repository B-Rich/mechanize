Download
--------

You can install from source, or using
[EasyInstall](http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall):

    easy-install mechanize

[git access](./#git) is also available.

All documentation (including this web page) is included in the distribution.

This is a stable release.

  * [mechanize-@(version).tar.gz](./src/mechanize-@(version).tar.gz)

  * [mechanize-@(version).zip](./src/mechanize-@(version).zip)

  * [Change Log](./src/ChangeLog.txt) (included in distribution)

  * [Older versions.](./src/)

For an installation procedure that does not invoke EasyInstall's dependency
resolution system, see the INSTALL file included with the distribution.

Note re Windows and Mac support: currently the tests are only routinely run on
Ubuntu karmic.  However, as far as I know, mechanize works fine on Windows and
Mac platforms.
